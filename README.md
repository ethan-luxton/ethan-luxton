<h2 align="center">Welcome to my GitHub! 

<h3 align="center">👨‍💻 Hello! I'm Ethan. 👨‍💻</h3>

I am a finance professional with a background in marketing and public relations. After working in retail banking and wealth management, I decided to pursue my passion for technology and transition into the software development field.

Since the age of 13, I have been honing my skills in programming languages like C#, Java, C++, JavaScript, and Python. My current objective is to contribute to the technologies that shape our everyday lives, from operating systems to full-stack web development.

As I navigate this career shift, I remain committed to learning and adapting my skill set. With a creative background in photography and graphic design, I also aim to bring a unique perspective to my development projects.

<p align="center">Join me as we explore the exciting future of technology and innovation together.</p>
